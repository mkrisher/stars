[situation]::1-2 paragraphs describing the context of your scenario. Particularly, connect to why the scenario at hand was important to your company: revenue dipped so we needed to XYZ, our top engineering priority was scaling our organization efficiently but we were struggling to hire, etc.
#Situation

Shortly after starting at a fintech company, I was asked to take over the Director role for the 
data platform. A team existed but was completely demoralized. Their previous leader has been asked 
to leave. The majority of the team had come over alongside the leader from Living Social. The 
solution they were supporting had been created by the CTO on a weekend bender and put into 
Production. The remaining members were spread across two different offices in two different time 
zones.

[task]::What specifically were you asked to take on? It’s OK to acknowledge the team’s broader remit, but immediately follow by narrowing in on your work, not the broader team’s work. Don’t camouflage your efforts within the team’s.
#Task

The task at hand was to rejuvenate the team. A direction was needed. A purpose other than keeping 
the existing solution running was needed. Improving performance and delivering new features were 
needed. Retention was needed. It was a large task considering the small size of the team and the 
business value being recognized.

[actions]::If you overuse “we” to describe team actions, interviewers will be unclear about your specific role. It’s OK to use “we” sometimes in your answer, but you must use “I” statements describing your specific work.
#Actions

First thing I put in place was a weekly fireside chat. The whole team was invited, everyone from 
engineering, QA, Product, Data, etc. Because of the time zones it happened over video, cameras were 
turned on. It happened on Monday mornings and time was reserved to talk about our intentions for 
the week, as well as, answer any questions the team had. No JIRA boards or any formal agenda, just 
time reserved to chat and build camaraderie. The first few were rough. A bit of Festivus happened. 
But giving the team this space and being inclusive started to lift spirits.  The team started being 
proactive about their direction. We started plotting a new course. We brought in some team members 
to help with the new direction.

Meanwhile, we invested some energy into improving the existing solution just enough that we didn’t 
have to babysit it all hours of the night. We weren’t aiming to build off of it or even make it 
better, we just needed it to be maintainable. That bought us some points with the CTO who had 
authored it. By doing so, we could use the information to sell our proposal for a new real-time 
solution with the CTO’s approval.

I got my hands dirty and was “on-call”, so the team could focus on the replacement. They had not 
had a “player-coach” before. Orders were top down previously, people felt talked at and 
disrespected.

We continued our weekly fireside chats. They eventually shortened in length, but people claimed 
they were their favorite meetings.

[results]::Whenever possible, these should be quantitative, numerical results.
#Results

The team hit a stride and rhythm and became an influencer on other engineering teams. We introduced 
true DevOps. We introduced Machine Learning. We built a real-time solution. We accelerated the time 
it took to ship features. This was no longer a demoralized team and it was on display pretty 
clearly during the company wide Sprint demos. We gained the trust of the CTO. We retained all team 
members and grew the size of the team. Members from other teams asked to join on our team.

Most importantly, the team was no longer demoralized. Through some very simple processes we were 
able to air the grievances and then start to be proactive about our future. We kept the lights on 
and innovated. There were plenty of late nights and pleading our case, but being confident in our 
proposals and executing at a high level was a complete 180 degrees from where the team was at a 
short year prior.

Many of us still work together to this day, granted at a different venture, but that says something.
