[situation]::1-2 paragraphs describing the context of your scenario. Particularly, connect to why the scenario at hand was important to your company: revenue dipped so we needed to XYZ, our top engineering priority was scaling our organization efficiently but we were struggling to hire, etc.
#Situation

At Kenna Security, I joined as the first fulltime software engineer. Employee
number 5. There were two other people contributing to the codebase already, but 
engineering was not their fulltime responsibility.

During my time, the company grew in every way possible. We graduated from our 
temporary co-working space to our meager, but official office space. We grew the
engineering team. We hired a sales team. We opened a San Francisco office. 
We even hired a new CEO (twice).

BUT, we were not Facebook or Google. We moved fast because were small. But we
didn't break things, because we had customers. Customers that paid for our
services.

[task]::What specifically were you asked to take on? It’s OK to acknowledge the team’s broader remit, but immediately follow by narrowing in on your work, not the broader team’s work. Don’t camouflage your efforts within the team’s.
#Task

Our task was to offer a service that security practioners could use to improve
their security posture. Sexy stuff. Like I said, we were Facebook or Google. We
were niche and developing a product, not a platform.

A given with the task was to create a solid foundation that features could be
solidly developed on. And once established, hire a competent team that could
develop, deliver, and maintain features.

[actions]::If you overuse “we” to describe team actions, interviewers will be unclear about your specific role. It’s OK to use “we” sometimes in your answer, but you must use “I” statements describing your specific work.
#Actions

My role was two fold. I helped established the foundation of the production from
a technical point of view. I started as an engineer and became our lead
engineer. I/we made some mistakes along the way, but we quickly recovered or
pivoted. We implemented Elasticsearch before it was even at a 1.0 release. We
ran into situations their support team didn't have solutions for. I implemented
an OAuth solution for single sign on for our largest partner–Dell Secureworks.

Once the app foundation was in place, I was directly responsible for hiring
engineers. I conducted almost every interview. I did phone screens. I did
in-person interviews. I recruited. I helped decide when we were ready to support
bringing on the first junior engineer.

As the team grew, I helped establish process and culture. I spent a lot of time
in Pivotal building a healthy backlog. I helped establish a pattern of
developing on remote EC2 instances that could be shared to demo features. This
was a little ahead of its time, but it really helped us accelerate onboarding.

[results]::Whenever possible, these should be quantitative, numerical results.
#Results

In the end, the engineering team was more than 13 when I left. It included
seniors, juniors and qa engineers. The customer base grew from a few beta 
testers to over 100 paying companies. We had a solid partnership with Dell
Secureworks.

The foundation of Rails, MySQL, and Elasticsearch stood the test of time and 
remained in place. Ultimately, the company was sold to Cisco. 

[questions]::These questions are not classically part of the STAR format, but are typical follow up questions. Don’t include this additional context in your initial response, but it may be helpful in preparing for the interview.
#Bonus questions

What could have gone better? / What would you do differently?

We could have done a number of things differently. One of which was break out
the key scanner data import process from the monolith. That pattern proved to 
be inflexible. We lost some data more than once.

We could have held off on hiring our first sales team until the product was a
little more mature. We could have built out a more formal roadmap and
established our engineering needs around it. In general, we were founder lead
rather than Product lead.

When the founder decided to hire a CEO to help with funding, we could have not 
hired the first peson we hired. He was a big mistake. Little did we know, he 
was trying to be a CEO at another company during this time and was only going 
to work for us half the time. Glaring oversight. Don't assume people are 
forthcoming. Quickly recover as soon as you discover these things.

Could you have gotten the same results with half the budget?

In regards to our use of Elasticsearch, absolutely. Like I said prior, their
support team was still in their infancy and couldn't help much.

We could have postponed hiring an expensive sales team. We could have spent more
time on building a healthy backlog of items that didn't require senior engineers
to implement. This would have required less feature developer in the middle
stages and more planning and process. We moved fast developing features which we
had the ability to do, but we didn't exactly measure if the features were
successful. Ultimately, we could have measured in order to determine if the
budget in engineering time and actually cash money was being well spent.
