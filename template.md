[task]::What specifically were you asked to take on? It’s OK to acknowledge the team’s broader remit, but immediately follow by narrowing in on your work, not the broader team’s work. Don’t camouflage your efforts within the team’s.
#Task

#Actions

[results]::Whenever possible, these should be quantitative, numerical results.
#Results

[questions]::These questions are not classically part of the STAR format, but are typical follow up questions. Don’t include this additional context in your initial response, but it may be helpful in preparing for the interview.
